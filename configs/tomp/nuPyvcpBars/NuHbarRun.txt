to run a config using the new pyvcp bar widgets
is like othe configs

you will create an .ini, a custon.hal, and xnl
and
uf you want graphical thumbs ( the marker that moves aloong the bar)
 you will need to create a small python tkinter .py file that draws the marker
 ( and set the tag' dwgf to that file spec )
 or creates/copy a suitible png file
 ( and set the tag 'imgf' to that file spec )

i used a full file spec for imgf
i placed my .dwg file alomgside pyvcp_widgets.py
  which is in /lib/python3/dist_packages/   for NON RIP
  and is in ~/linuxcnc-dev/configs/tomp/NuPyvcpBars/  for me ( ymmv)

my test .imi is  pyTktab04.ini
   the .ini will use AXIS gui and create a pyvcp tab with many aniumated bars
   the ini expects local file  bars.xml ( same dir as .ini)
   the .ini's PROGRAM_PREFIX must be adapted to your situation
   the .ini [FILTER} section was chamghed to   py - python3   izzat necc/good?
   the .ini [HAL] section has  POSTGUI_HALFILE = custom4.hal

place bars.xml in same dir as .ini

place custom4.hal in same dir as .ini

custom4.gal requires rand9
  a python hal comp that is a random number generator 
    used to to drive bar widgets
    so ramd9 must be with the other hal comps
