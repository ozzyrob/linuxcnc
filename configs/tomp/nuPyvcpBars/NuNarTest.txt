to test the pyvcp bars

edit bars1.xml to change tag values
   use <!--tag?value</tag--> to hide trials

edit bars1.hal to change driver propetries
  the drive for the bardemo is a siggen
  the amplitude and offset must agree with the xml min and max
  for example in min is 0 and max is 100
    then the siggen sin amplitude is *max-min)/2 = 60
    and the offset would be -
  for example, if min is -125 and max is -32
    then the amplitude is (-32 - -125)/2 = 45.5
    and the offset will be ( -32  - 42/.5 ) = -74.5
    ( the sinus will oscillate about -74.5, 
      rising towards Min od -32 
      and falling towards -125
   You can adjust the freq as desired but note
   there seems to be a beat freq on my system, 
   you mayt experience it too,
   so use freqs od 10 20 30 40 50 60 etc
   It maybe my monitor or the thread speed or both. oi dunno
   It is not an error of the program

to run your test on a RIP
cd 
cd path/to/your/linuxcncdev/dir
   mine is ~/linuxcnc-barwidgets/configs/tomp/nuPyvcpBars$ 
   yours will be something like the following
cd ~/linuxcnc-dev/configs/<dirwhere you have your test .xml and .hal >

halrun -I -f bars1.hal

have fun
tomp
